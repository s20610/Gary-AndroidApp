# Gary-AndroidApp
This is a repository with source code of my engineering thesis project. Gary is an app that helps people with calling for help in emergency situations.

Functionalities for User:
* Creating a new incident (picking location on map, type of incident, number of victims)
* Browsing history of created incidents
* Reading medical tutorials on how to perform CPR (example)
* Adding medical information that will help medics when they arrive on site
* Map of emergency facilities nearby

Functionalities for Medics:
* Navigation to the currently assigned incident
* Information about the incident and medical information of victim if bandcode was scanned
* Updating usage of ambulance equipment
* Updating information about casualties/injured civillians on site
* Scanning bandcodes of app users to display their medical information
* Initiating a crew break to let dispatch know that ambulance is currently unavailable
