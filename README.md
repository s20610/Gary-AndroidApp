# Gary-AndroidApp
This is a repository with source code of my engineering thesis project. Gary is an app that helps people with calling for help in emergency situations. It's fully translated into two languages: Polish and English

Functionalities for User:
* Creating a new incident (picking location on map, type of incident, number of victims)
* Browsing history of created incidents
* Reading medical tutorials on how to perform CPR (example)
* Adding medical information that will help medics when they arrive on site
* Map of emergency facilities nearby

Functionalities for Medics:
* Navigation to the currently assigned incident
* Information about the incident and medical information of victim if bandcode was scanned
* Updating usage of ambulance equipment
* Updating information about casualties/injured civillians on site
* Scanning bandcodes of app users to display their medical information
* Initiating a crew break to let dispatch know that ambulance is currently unavailable

Used technologies:
* Android SDK
* Retrofit2
* Material Design 2 components
* OSMDroid - library that allows developers to use openstreetmaps in their projects
* Zxing - library that allowed us to easily incorporate barcode scanning into our app
* Glide - loading images from the web
